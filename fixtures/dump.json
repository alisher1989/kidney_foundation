Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.\r\n\r\nTreatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.",

Diabetes happens when your blood sugar is too high, causing damage to many organs in your body, including the kidneys and heart, as well as blood vessels, nerves and eyes. High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the pressure of your blood against the walls of your blood vessels increases. If uncontrolled, or poorly controlled, high blood pressure can be a leading cause of heart attacks, strokes and chronic kidney disease. Also, chronic kidney disease can cause high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nOther conditions that affect the kidneys are:\r\n\r\n1) Glomerulonephritis, a group of diseases that cause inflammation and damage to the kidney's filtering units. These disorders are the third most common type of kidney disease.\r\n2) Inherited diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, which causes large cysts to form in the kidneys and damage the surrounding tissue.\r\n3) Malformations that occur as a baby develops in its mother's womb. For example, a narrowing may occur that prevents normal outflow of urine and causes urine to flow back up to the kidney. This causes infections and may damage the kidneys.\r\n4) Lupus and other diseases that affect the body's immune system.\r\n5) Obstructions caused by problems like kidney stones, tumors or an enlarged prostate gland in men.\r\n6) Repeated urinary infections.",

    "title": "10 Common Habits That May Harm Your Kidneys",
    "text": "It's not too late to unlearn these damaging behaviors. Here a list of ten common habits that you might not realize are putting pressure on your kidneys. \r\n\r\n1. Overusing Painkillers\r\nOver the counter pain medicines, such as NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), may alleviate your aches and pains, but they can harm the kidneys, especially if you already have kidney disease. Reduce your regular use of NSAIDs and never go over the recommended dosage.\r\n\r\n2. Abusing the Salt Shaker\r\nDiets high in salt are high in sodium, which can increase blood pressure and, in turn, harm your kidneys.  Flavor your foods with herbs and spices instead of salt. Over time, you may find it easier to avoid using added salt (sodium) on your food. \r\n\r\n3. Eating Processed Foods\r\nProcessed foods are significant sources of sodium and phosphorus. Many people who have kidney disease need to limit phosphorus in their diets. Some studies have shown that high phosphorus intake from processed foods in people without kidney disease may be harmful to their kidneys and bones. Try adopting the DASH diet to guide your healthy eating habits.\r\n\r\n4. Not Drinking Enough Water\r\nStaying well hydrated helps your kidneys clear sodium and toxins from the body. Drinking plenty of water is also one of the best ways to avoid painful kidney stones. Those with kidney problems or kidney failure may need to restrict their fluid intake, but for most people, drinking 1.5 to 2 liters (3 to 4 pints) of water per day is a healthy target.\r\n\r\n5. Missing Out on Sleep\r\nA good night\u2019s rest is extremely important to your overall well-being and, it turns out, your kidneys. Kidney function is regulated by the sleep-wake cycle which helps coordinate the kidneys\u2019 workload over 24 hours. \r\n\r\n6. Eating Too Much Meat\r\nAnimal protein generates high amounts of acid in the blood that can be harmful to the kidneys and cause acidosis \u2013 a condition in which kidneys cannot eliminate acid fast enough. Protein is needed for growth, upkeep and repair of all parts of the body but your diet should be well balanced with fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n7. Eating Too Many Foods High in Sugar\r\nSugar contributes to obesity which increases your risk of developing high blood pressure and diabetes, two of the leading causes of kidney disease. In addition to desserts, sugar is often added to foods and drinks that you may not consider \u201csweet.\u201d Avoid condiments, breakfast cereals, and white bread which are all sneaky sources of processed sugar. Pay attention to the ingredients when buying packaged goods to avoid added sugar in your diet.\r\n\r\n8. Lighting Up\r\nSure, smoking isn't good for your lungs or your heart. But did you know that smoking may not be good for your kidneys either? People who smoke are more likely to have protein in the urine \u2013 a sign of kidney damage.\r\n\r\n9. Drinking Alcohol in Excess \r\nRegular heavy drinking \u2013 more than four drinks a day \u2013 has been found to double the risk chronic kidney disease. Heavy drinkers who also smoke have an even higher risk of kidney problems. Smokers who are heavy drinkers have about five times the chance of developing chronic kidney disease than people who don\u2019t smoke or drink alcohol to excess.\r\n\r\n10. Sitting Still \r\nSitting for long periods of time has now been linked to the development of kidney disease. Although researchers don\u2019t know yet why or how sedentary time or physical activity directly impact kidney health, it is known that greater physical activity is associated with  improved blood pressure and glucose metabolism, both important factors in kidney health. \r\n\r\n*This article is intended to help prevent kidney disease. If you've been told to limit your potassium or phosphorus or are on dialysis, discuss your personal dietary needs with your dietitian or nephrologist.",

    "title": "What is a kidney transplant?",
    "text": "A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure that\u2019s done to treat kidney failure. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and remove it from the body through your urine. They also help maintain your body\u2019s fluid and electrolyte balance. If your kidneys stop working, waste builds up in your body and can make you very sick.\r\n\r\nPeople whose kidneys have failed usually undergo a treatment called dialysis. This treatment mechanically filters waste that builds up in the bloodstream when the kidneys stop working.\r\n\r\nSome people whose kidneys have failed may qualify for a kidney transplant. In this procedure, one or both kidneys are replaced with donor kidneys from a live or deceased person.\r\n\r\nThere are pros and cons to both dialysis and kidney transplants.\r\n\r\nUndergoing dialysis takes time and is labor-intensive. Dialysis often requires making frequent trips to a dialysis center to receive treatment. At the dialysis center, your blood is cleansed using a dialysis machine.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a candidate to have dialysis in your home, you\u2019ll need to purchase dialysis supplies and learn how to use them.\r\n\r\nA kidney transplant can free you from a long-term dependence on a dialysis machine and the strict schedule that goes with it. This can allow you to live a more active life. However, kidney transplants aren\u2019t suitable for everyone. This includes people with active infections and those who are severely overweight.\r\n\r\nDuring a kidney transplant, your surgeon will take a donated kidney and place it in your body. Even though you\u2019re born with two kidneys, you can lead a healthy life with only one functioning kidney. After the transplant, you\u2019ll have to take immune-suppressing medications to keep your immune system from attacking the new organ.",

Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood.\r\nUrine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease.\r\nImaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases.\r\nRemoving a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue.

    "text": "To reduce your risk of developing diabetic kidney disease:\r\n\r\nTreat your diabetes. With effective treatment of diabetes, you may prevent or delay diabetic kidney disease.\r\nManage high blood pressure or other medical conditions. If you have high blood pressure or other conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.\r\nFollow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), follow the instructions on the package. For people with diabetic kidney disease, taking these types of pain relievers can lead to kidney damage.\r\nMaintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about weight-loss strategies, such as increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories.\r\nDon't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop.",

    "text": "Determining the type of kidney stone you have is usually done by evaluating a 24-hour collection of urine, or by examining a stone after it has been passed. There are several methods of renal stone removal; many don't require surgery. You may even be able to pass a stone by drinking lots of water.\r\n\r\nSome of the treatments for kidney stones that are too large to pass, or are causing damage, include:\r\n\r\nShock wavesthat are sent directly to the kidney stone. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or sound waves is not an invasive treatment, so it doesn't require surgery or a hospital stay.\r\nNephrolithotomy, or percutaneous (meaning \"through the skin\") nephrolithotomy, is when the doctor makes a small incision in your back and removes the kidney stone using a nephroscope.\r\nUreteroscopic kidney stone removal is a procedure that uses a scope passed through the bladder to remove a stone that is stuck in the ureter.",

    "title": "What treatments are available for glomerulonephritis?",
    "text": "Treatment options depend on the type of GN you\u2019re experiencing and its cause.\r\n\r\nOne treatment is to control high blood pressure, especially if that\u2019s the underlying cause of the GN. Blood pressure may be very hard to control when your kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. If this is the case, your doctor may prescribe blood pressure medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors, such as:\r\n\r\ncaptopril\r\nlisinopril (Zestril)\r\nperindopril (Aceon)\r\nYour doctor may also prescribe angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs, such as:\r\n\r\nlosartan (Cozaar)\r\nirbesartan (Avapro)\r\nvalsartan (Diovan)\r\nCorticosteroids may also be used if your immune system is attacking your kidneys. They reduce the immune response.\r\n\r\nAnother method to reduce immune-triggered inflammation is plasmapheresis. This process removes the fluid part of your blood, called plasma, and replaces it with intravenous fluids or donated plasma that contains no antibodies.\r\n\r\nFor chronic GN, you\u2019ll need to reduce the amount of protein, salt, and potassium in your diet. Additionally, you must watch how much liquid you drink. Calcium supplements may be recommended, and you may need to take diuretics to reduce swelling. Check with your general practitioner or kidney specialist for guidelines about diet restrictions or supplements. They can set you up with a medical dietician to advise you on your choices.\r\n\r\nIf your condition becomes advanced and you develop kidney failure, you may need to have dialysis. In this procedure, a machine filters your blood. Eventually, you may need a kidney transplant.",

In peritoneal dialysis, the inside lining of your own belly acts as a natural filter. Wastes are taken out by means of a cleansing fluid called dialysate, which is washed in and out of your belly in cycles."

    "text": "Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)\r\nAutomated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD)\r\nThe basic treatment is the same for each. However, the number of treatments and the way the treatments are done make each method different.\r\n\r\nCAPD is \"continuous,\" machine-free and done while you go about your normal activities such as work or school. You do the treatment by placing about two quarts of cleansing fluid into your belly and later draining it. This is done by hooking up a plastic bag of cleansing fluid to the tube in your belly. Raising the plastic bag to shoulder level causes gravity to pull the fluid into your belly. When empty, the plastic bag is removed and thrown away.\r\n\r\nWhen an exchange (putting in and taking out the fluid) is finished, the fluid (which now has wastes removed from your blood) is drained from your belly and thrown away. This process usually is done three, four or five times in a 24-hour period while you are awake during normal activities. Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Some patients like to do their exchanges at mealtimes and at bedtime.\r\n\r\nAPD differs from CAPD in that a machine (cycler) delivers and then drains the cleansing fluid for you. The treatment usually is done at night while you sleep."

    "text": "Some doctors feel that CAPD and APD have several benefits when compared to hemodialysis. With continuous dialysis, you can control extra fluid more easily, and this may reduce stress on the heart and blood vessels. You are able to eat more and use fewer medications. You can do more of your daily activities and it is easier to work or travel.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some people for whom peritoneal dialysis may not be appropriate. The abdomen or belly of some people, particularly those who are morbidly obese or those with multiple prior abdominal surgeries, may make peritoneal dialysis treatments difficult or impossible. Peritonitis (infection of abdomen) is an occasional complication although should be infrequent with appropriate precautions. When making a decision about the type of treatment, you should take into consideration that peritoneal dialysis is usually a daily process, similar to the working of the kidney and may be more gentle with fluid removal from the body. Peritoneal dialysis is an effective form of dialysis, has been proven to be as good as hemodialysis.\r\n\r\nPeritoneal dialysis is not for everyone. People must receive training and be able to perform correctly each of the steps of the treatment. A trained helper may also be used."
